# Luffy's Journey
A RPG game based around the theme of "Failure is progress". The game has 3 levels. Each level's difficulty depends on how poorly the player performed in the previous level. To progress, a player must strike a good balance between surviving and making a fool out of themselves while the game assesses their performance.
