# Luffy's Journey
A RPG game based around the theme of "Failure is progress". The game has 3 levels. Each level's difficulty depends on how poorly the player performed in the previous level. To progress, a player must strike a good balance between surviving and making a fool out of themselves while the game assesses their performance.

## Gameplay

## Story
An injured Luffy is on the battlefield. He is stuck at Marineford, on the battlefield, fighting marine troops and the three fierce navy admirals. He needs to hold out till the rest of the Straw-hat crew arrive and save him. There is a catch though - the navy is constantly changing their opinion on Luffy. Luffy's perfomance during a level determines how many admirals and which admirals will fight him, in the next level. Luffy needs to balance surviving and looking like a fool in front of the navy's eyes.
